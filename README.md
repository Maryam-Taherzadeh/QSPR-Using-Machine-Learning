# QSPR-Using-Machine-Learning
Development of QSPR model by using coupling of genetic algorithm (GA) and (SR)/ and SVM and ANN

Development of QSPR model by using coupling of genetic algorithm (GA) and (SR) as variables selection and support vector machine(SVM) as modeling tool to predict (ùõæ13 ‚àû) some organic compounds in ionic liquid of [BMPYR] [TCM] and the results obtained using SRSVM and GA-SVM were compared with the experimental values.
